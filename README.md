# Minitalk! a 42 project 

hello this is my project for the minitalk 42school assignment, i have decided to make it as portable and compliant with usual linux development as possible. this is the first time i truly batttled with using many libraries at once, my makefiles are probably not perfect but they are functional :) 


### to do 
- binary conversion
- signal handling
- proper pause timing
- gitignore (no need to fclean before all commits)
